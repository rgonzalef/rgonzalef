## About me:
I have been an Electronic Engineer for more than 15 years.
From 2022, I set out to work as a software developer, being this the starting point to become a "multiskills" professional, with high technological skills that will allow me to face the fourth industrial revolution and thus be able to facilitate the use of technology to people and companies in order to help them achieve their goals.
